Loss of plasticity, in the context of deep learning, refers to the phenomenon where a neural network gradually loses its ability to learn new information after being trained on a sequence of tasks or for an extended period.  It's akin to a brain becoming less adaptable and less able to acquire new knowledge over time.

Here's a breakdown of key aspects:

* **How it manifests:**  The network's performance on new tasks degrades, sometimes to the point where it performs no better than a simple, shallow network or even a linear model. This isn't the same as catastrophic forgetting (where the network forgets previously learned information).  Instead, it's about the *capacity* to learn anything new diminishing.

* **Underlying causes:** Research suggests several contributing factors:

    * **Dead Units:**  Especially prevalent with ReLU activation functions, some neurons become "dead" or inactive during training.  Their output is always zero, meaning they contribute nothing to the network's learning process.
    * **Weight Magnitude Growth:** The average magnitude of the network's weights tends to increase over time.  This can lead to slower learning and make the network less sensitive to subtle changes in new data.
    * **Decreased Effective Rank:** The effective rank of a matrix reflects the number of dimensions that significantly contribute to the information it represents. In neural networks, the effective rank of the representation learned by hidden layers decreases with extended training. This loss of dimensionality means the network has fewer distinct ways to represent new information, reducing its learning capacity.  Essentially, the neurons become more similar to one another and less diverse in their responses.

* **Impact on continual learning:** Loss of plasticity is a major hurdle for continual learning, where a network must learn from a continuous stream of data and adapt to changing environments.  Traditional deep learning methods, primarily based on gradient descent, are ill-equipped to handle this.

* **Mitigating loss of plasticity:**  Several approaches show promise:

    * **L2 Regularization:**  This classic technique penalizes large weights, helping keep the network's weights small and thus more adaptable.
    * **Shrink and Perturb:** This method combines L2 regularization with the injection of small random perturbations to the weights, promoting diversity and preventing units from becoming inactive.
    * **Continual Backpropagation:** This novel approach reinitializes a small fraction of the *least-used* neurons at each training step, injecting fresh randomness and maintaining diversity without disrupting already learned information.  This method is inspired by the biological process of neurogenesis (the formation of new neurons) and shows strong results.

* **Relation to other phenomena:** There are connections between loss of plasticity and other concepts like the lottery ticket hypothesis, dynamic sparse training, and different forms of weight initialization.  These areas are still actively being researched.

In summary, loss of plasticity is a serious challenge for deep learning systems operating in continually changing environments.  It highlights the limitations of relying solely on gradient descent and emphasizes the need for methods that actively maintain diversity and adaptability within the network.  New algorithms like continual backpropagation offer promising avenues for overcoming this limitation and enabling truly lifelong learning in artificial neural networks.
