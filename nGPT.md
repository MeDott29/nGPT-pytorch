nGPT (normalized GPT) is a Transformer-based architecture that operates on the hypersphere.  This means all vectors involved (embeddings, hidden states, attention matrices, MLP weights) are normalized to unit length. This core difference from traditional Transformers leads to several interesting properties and training dynamics.  Here's a breakdown of how nGPT works:

**1. Core Principle: Hyperspherical Representation**

Instead of operating in Euclidean space like standard Transformers, nGPT constrains all its vector representations to lie on the surface of a hypersphere. This is achieved through L2 normalization (dividing each vector by its magnitude).  This constraint is applied to:

* **Token Embeddings:**  The initial representation of input tokens.
* **Hidden States:**  The intermediate representations throughout the network layers.
* **Attention Matrices (Q, K, V, and Output Projection):** The weight matrices used within the attention mechanism.
* **MLP Weights:**  The weights within the feedforward layers.

**2. Normalized Linear Transformations**

Because all vectors are normalized, matrix multiplications (which are the core operations in Transformers) become analogous to computing cosine similarities.  The paper introduces `NormLinear`, a modified linear layer that incorporates L2 normalization of its weights. This simplifies weight updates and eliminates the need for traditional weight decay.

**3. Hyperspherical Interpolation (Slerp Approximation)**

Instead of directly adding residual connections like in standard Transformers, nGPT uses a form of spherical linear interpolation (Slerp).  Slerp calculates the shortest path between two points on a sphere.  However, the paper approximates Slerp with regular linear interpolation (Lerp) for computational efficiency. This interpolation is controlled by learnable "eigen learning rates" (α).

* **Residual Updates:** The output of each attention and MLP block is normalized and then interpolated with the normalized input to the block using Lerp.  This can be visualized as moving the hidden state vector along the surface of the hypersphere.  Mathematically, it looks like this: `h ← Norm(h + α * (h_block_output - h))`

**4. Learned Scaling Factors**

nGPT introduces several learned scaling factors (s) throughout the architecture. These scales are necessary because normalization removes magnitude information.  They act as learned adjustments to the effective learning rates of various components:

* **s_qk:** Scales the query (Q) and key (K) vectors in attention.
* **s_ff_hidden and s_ff_gate:** Scales the hidden and gate values in the SwiGLU activation function within the MLP.
* **s_logit:** Scales the logits before the softmax layer.

**5. Training and Weight Normalization**

After each training batch, *all* weight matrices and embeddings are re-normalized to maintain the hyperspherical constraint.  This repeated normalization is crucial for nGPT's performance.

**Key Differences from Standard Transformers:**

* **Hyperspherical Constraint:**  The fundamental difference, forcing all operations onto the hypersphere.
* **Normalized Linear Layers:** Replaces standard linear layers to maintain normalization and simplify weight updates.
* **Slerp/Lerp Residual Connections:**  Replaces additive residual connections with interpolations on the hypersphere.
* **Learned Scaling Factors:**  Introduces learnable scaling parameters to compensate for magnitude information lost during normalization.
* **No Traditional Normalization Layers:** Eliminates the need for LayerNorm or RMSNorm.
* **No Weight Decay:** The weight normalization process replaces explicit weight decay.

**Applying nGPT to Your Problem:**

1. **Understand Your Data:** Is your data inherently directional or relational, where representing it on a hypersphere might be beneficial?  Examples where this might be true include word embeddings, user profiles, or other data where the direction or angle between vectors is more important than their absolute magnitude.
2. **Adapt the Input/Output:** You'll need to adjust how your data is represented as input to nGPT.  If it's discrete data (like text), you'll still need an embedding layer, but its output will be normalized.  For continuous data, you may need to preprocess it to be represented on the hypersphere.  The output layer will also need to be adapted to your specific task.
3. **Consider Scaling:** You'll likely need to tune the various scaling factors (s and α) for your specific problem and dataset.
4. **Implementation:**  You'll need to either modify an existing Transformer library or implement nGPT from scratch, including the `NormLinear` layers and the hyperspherical Lerp residual connections.


nGPT's faster convergence is a compelling advantage, especially for resource-constrained settings.
